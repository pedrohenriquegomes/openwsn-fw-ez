# MABO-TSCH - Multi-hop And Blacklisted-based Optimized TSCH

Source code with implementation of [MABO-TSCH][1] protocol.

This code was based on [OpenWSN][2] 1.10.

This protocol is an adaptation of TSCH protocol.

It implements a distributed blacklist for improving the performance of multi-hop wireless networks that have to cope with high levels of external interference and multi-path fading.
It was introduced in the paper below. Please cite it if you use this source code.
